## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-05 - The Next-Generation Deployment

Greetings, Helldivers! This is a complete overhaul of the Stratagem Helper, rebuilt from the ground up on the new Flutter framework for enhanced performance, stability, and future readiness. This is a mandatory update for all personnel.

### ‚ú® Added
-   **Full Application Rewrite:** The entire application has been modernized on the Flutter platform.
-   **Stratagem Editor:** Full capability to Add, Edit, and Delete both stratagems and categories, including new sub-categories for enhanced organization.
-   **Advanced Loadout Manager:** Save, load, delete, and overwrite full loadouts, now including assigned hotkeys.
-   **Stratagem Trainer v2:** An immersive training simulator with three distinct modes:
    -   **Practice:** No-pressure drills with a shorter timer.
    -   **Standard:** Full-featured timed mode with dynamic scoring and time bonuses.
    -   **Scrambled:** An elite mode for veterans where codes are randomized and must be entered before they become unstable.
-   **Live Leaderboard:** A new screen to view top Helldiver scores, fetched directly from the Ministry of Truth's servers. Now includes patriot identification images.
-   **Automated Crash Reporter:** In the event of a critical malfunction, a separate utility will now launch to prepare a telemetry report for submission.
-   **Auto-Updater:** The application will now check for new versions on startup and prompt the user to install them.
-   **Sound Effects:** Added a full suite of audio feedback for UI interactions and trainer events to improve immersion.
-   **Data Versioning System:** A new system automatically updates stratagem data to the latest schematics from High Command while preserving user-created additions.

### üêõ Fixed & Improved
-   **Complete Overhaul of Hotkey System:** Replaced the underlying hotkey and keystroke services to eliminate race conditions, preventing "stuck modifier key" bugs and improving stability.
-   **Application Shutdown:** Resolved a critical bug where the application process would not terminate correctly after closing the window. The app now shuts down cleanly.
-   **Server-Side Stability:** Rewrote and hardened all server-side API endpoints and file system permissions to resolve all `500 Internal Server Errors` and ensure reliable data handling.
-   **UI & Theme:** The entire user interface has been redesigned with a more consistent, modern, and themed look across all screens and dialogs.

## [2.5.2] - 2025-06-21

This is a hotfix release that adds a crucial user notification system for a legacy data bug and improves the stability of the settings manager.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Loadout Corruption Warning:** A new "Illuminate Infiltration" dialog will now appear on every launch if the application detects saved loadouts with missing timing data from a previous bug. The dialog now lists the specific loadouts that require fixing.

### üêõ Fixed
- The "Edit/Save Loadout" dialog now correctly populates with default timing values instead of blank fields when creating a new loadout.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the "About" dialog to crash on open.

---

## [2.5.1] - 2025-06-21

This is a major stability and user experience hotfix that completely overhauls the loadout management system to resolve all known bugs related to saving and loading timing and key configurations.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Data Update Notifications:** The application will now show a "Ministry of Truth" themed pop-up on startup to inform users of any automatic corrections made to the master stratagem list, such as fixing incorrect input codes.

### ‚ú® Changed
- The "Configure Loadouts" and "Configure Timing/Key" dialogs have been removed and replaced with a single, powerful **"Manage Loadouts and Settings"** dialog.
- This new, unified manager provides a much clearer and more reliable workflow for editing the name, icon, and all associated settings for a saved loadout.

### üêõ Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed a persistent bug where the "Tap/Hold" mode and "Stratagem Menu Key" settings would not save correctly to a loadout file.
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed a related bug where loading a saved loadout would fail to apply the correct "Tap/Hold" mode and other key settings.
- Resolved several `AttributeError` crashes that occurred when opening or interacting with the old loadout management dialogs.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2025-06-20

#### ‚ú® New Features

* **Quick Loadout Selection:** A new "Quick Loadout" dropdown menu and "Load" button have been added to the main "Hotkey Setup" tab. This provides users with a convenient way to apply a full loadout directly from the main screen.
    * The dropdown displays all saved loadouts with their assigned icons.
    * The "Load" button applies all settings from the selected loadout, including stratagem slots, timing, and key configurations.
    * The dropdown is automatically synchronized when loadouts are added, edited, or deleted.

#### üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Fixed `AttributeError` in Loadout Manager:** Resolved a critical bug in the `LoadoutManagerDialog` where attempting to update a loadout's details would cause a crash. The method `_on_update_selected_details_clicked` was referencing UI elements (`edit_name_le`, `edit_icon_svg_combo`) with incorrect variable names. It now correctly uses `dialog_edit_name_le` and `dialog_edit_icon_svg_combo`.
* **Fixed `AttributeError` on Startup:** Corrected a startup crash caused by the `_populate_loadout_dropdown_qt` method being missing from the `MainWindow` class after a recent refactor. The method has been restored, allowing the application to initialize correctly.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Code Refactoring

* Centralized loadout population logic by creating `_populate_main_loadout_combo` and ensuring it's called from all relevant update paths (`_load_initial_ui_state`, `_open_loadout_manager_dialog`, `_delete_selected_loadout_qt`, etc.) to maintain UI consistency.
